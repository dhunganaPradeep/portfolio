# `public/` Directory

The `public/` directory is used as a public server for static assets publicly available at a defined URL of your application.

You can get a file in the `public/` directory from your application's code or from a browser by the root URL `/`.

## Example

For example, referencing an image file in the public/img/ directory, available at the static URL `/img/nuxt.png`:

````html
<template>
  <img src="/img/nuxt.png" alt="Discover Nuxt 3" />
</template>
````











### Partial README Section: Terminal Feature

#### Terminal Feature Overview
The Terminal is a chaotic, interactive centerpiece of my personal portfolio, blending cyberpunk aesthetics with meme-fueled humor. Built with Vue.js, it engages visitors through a retro-styled command-line interface that roasts, jokes, and nudges them toward my `about-me`, `projects`, and `contact-me` pages. Powered by a sassy pet (CyberShiba), it delivers random popups, glitchy visuals, and a teal/pink/green palette to match the site’s vibe.

#### Key Components
- **Vue Component (`Terminal.vue`)**: Core logic for command processing, pet interactions, and UI animations.
- **CSS Styling**: Teal (#43D9AD), neon pink (#FF69B4), and matrix green (#00FF00) gradients, with holographic glows and glitch effects.
- **Vue Router**: Enables `goto` commands for seamless navigation to portfolio pages.
- **JavaScript**: Drives meme triggers, roast prompts, and Chaos Mode events.

#### Commands
- `help`: Lists all commands.
- `chat roast <name> <job>`: Delivers a savage roast based on the job (e.g., “Bob, a dev? Bet you git push ‘undefined’ to prod.”).
- `chat joke`: Spits a random hacker/crypto quip (20+ options).
- `hack`: Boosts score with a chaotic points multiplier.
- `pet [name/feed]`: Renames or feeds the pet, updating its ASCII vibe.
- `shop [item]`: Buys meme gear like “Meme Nuke” for chaos.
- `theme`: Toggles between neon and matrix color schemes.
- `clear`: Resets the terminal, trolling the user.
- `score`: Shows your chaos score.
- `meme`: Triggers a random meme event (e.g., Shiba stampede).
- `goto [about-me/projects/contact-me]`: Navigates to portfolio pages.
- Easter eggs: `shiba`, `wojak`, `rat`, `yolo`, `fomo` for +100 points and art.

#### Meme, Roast, and Joke Functionality
- **Memes**: Chaos Mode (20% chance per command) spawns 10+ events like Wojak crying, Spinning Rat, or “This is Fine” dog, with “Meme Nuke” flooding 15 emojis.
- **Roasts**: `chat roast` targets user inputs with job-specific burns, paired with pet sass and particle effects.
- **Jokes**: 20+ quips (e.g., “Why’d the script fail? *Semicolon* identity crisis.”) trigger randomly, sometimes sparking Chaos Mode.
- **Pet Interaction**: CyberShiba evolves (WojakWarden, MemeMonarch), throwing shade like “Your score’s a *Reddit downvote* fest.”
- **Random Popups**: 15% chance to suggest commands (e.g., “`chat roast` to get *wrecked*!”), capped to avoid spam.

#### Why It’s Dope
- Ties portfolio pages to a meme RPG vibe, encouraging exploration.
- Glitchy UI and pet antics make every session screenshot-worthy.
- Lightweight (50-line cap, GPU animations) for smooth performance.
- Easter eggs and randomness keep users hooked without nagging.
